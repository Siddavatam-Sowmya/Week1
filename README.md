Week 1: Interactive Navigation Menu
Hello Everyone,

I’m excited to share my first project with Prodigy Infotech! In this task, I developed an interactive navigation menu using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The menu features dynamic styling that changes on hover, enhancing the overall user experience.

This project was a great opportunity to apply my web development skills and create a user-friendly interface. I’m looking forward to tackling more challenges and expanding my knowledge further!

Feel free to explore the code and provide any feedback!
